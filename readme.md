# Tensor Flow Layers
====================

The new [Tensor Flow library](http://www.tensorflow.org/) from Google introduces some awesome new tools for machine learning. Coming to TF from Torch, I find I tend to think more in terms of higher level modules like Torch's nn.SpatialConvolution, nn.Linear etc. rather than low level matrix operations operating directly on weights. I'm therefore hoping to add to this repo a selection of Torch-like modules implemented using Tensor Flow. Please feel free to use and contribute.
